/// DomainLookupTree is a data structure which provides efficient domain name lookup matching with
/// support for wildcard entries.
///
/// Requirements for this implementation:
/// - Given a domain name, determine if it matches an entry in the tree
/// - There can be an ever-growing amount of tree entries
/// - Entries can be absolute matches, e.g.: www.google.com
/// - Entries may be wildcard entries, which is denoted in the entry by providing a leading dot,
///   e.g.: .twitter.com, .en.wikipedia.org, .giggl.app
/// - Wildcard entries can not be embedded
///
/// To achieve this, we implement a simple tree-style structure which has a root structure that
/// contains a HashMap of nodes. These nodes can then contain other node decendants, and also be
/// marked as "wildcard" which means theres a rule that matches that domain level and all of its
/// decendants.
///
/// If, when performing a lookup, the search domain contains segments deeper than the wildcard
/// match, it can continue to traverse the tree until it exhausts its lookup options. At that
/// point, the deepest wildcard entry found would be returned, if no absolute match was found.
///
/// It's good to keep in mind that, when traversing the tree, domain names are sorted by top level
/// to infinite n-level, or in simpler terms, in reverse. This means that if "google.com" is looked
/// up in the tree, it would split by ".", reverse the vector, then first perform a root node
/// lookup for "com", and so on.
///
/// Walking down the tree - the story of a lookup:
/// Let's say have a DomainLookupTree with an entry ".giggl.app" which means that the tree looks
/// like this:
///
/// app
/// └── giggl [wildcard]
///
/// A domain lookup for "canary.giggl.app" is requested. First, "app" is matched, but it's not a
/// wildcard, so it's ignored. We now check the decendants of "app" for "giggl" - it matches, and
/// it's a wildcard match, so we store it within the context of the lookup. This lookup will now
/// 100% return a match, even if it isn't absolute. Anyway, we now check the decendants of "giggl"
/// for "canary", though it doesn't exist, and the traversal ends. Now, we didn't have an absolute
/// match, but we did have a wildcard match earlier on for ".giggl.app", so we successfully return
/// the result ".giggl.app" from the lookup function.
///
